Removing background noise from astronomical images is a main process required for further applications, including streaks detection, or galaxy identification. Previous tools depended on edge detecting, or frequency-domain-based removal, which caused bigger losses in astronomical imagery. This work compares different methods that remove noise and stars from backgrounds, within an optimisation for the conversation of the main objects in the image. The comparative study includes morphological filters, and diffusion-based methods, applied on the Australian Astronomical Observatory dataset. Compared to the morphological filters, the results showed cleared images for the diffusion methods.
